There was [quite some discussion around this one](https://twitter.com/brimwats/status/1323320467558551552). The largest issues boil down to monetary, followed by security issues. 

[Krista Jamieson](https://twitter.com/ArchiveThoughts), Digitization Manager, and [Heather Allen](https://twitter.com/allen_heather) notes that the material most often sent away is audiovisual, as most GLAMS do have scanners for paper material, but AV material is especially hard. 

The biggest concern, Marya VH notes is

> Because digitization is not preservation. Digital objects need to be kept track of, preserved and migrated, and made accessible, and we don't have time and resources to do that for most of our materials on top of all we do already.
