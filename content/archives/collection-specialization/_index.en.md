## Acquisition 

The process by which an GLAMS acquires material is called *[acquisition](https://dictionary.archivists.org/entry/acquisition.html).*

The simplest [answer](https://twitter.com/JordanMarieArch/status/1311719300139544582) to this question was articulated by archivist [Jordan Marie ](https://twitter.com/JordanMarieArch):

> Not every item related to a topic has the same level of historical value; we have to pick and choose those which are the most relevant/important. We also don’t have the funds/staff to collect every item, store them, and preserve them long-term.

The Peel Art Gallery Archives also addressed the entire process of acquisition  [in their blog post](https://peelarchivesblog.com/2018/04/04/what-do-archivists-keep-or-not/):

> People are often surprised to learn that typically only about five percent of most organizational records will be preserved permanently in the organization’s archives (we’ll see why in a moment). We call the acquisition of such records a transfer because the ownership of the records isn’t changing; they are simply coming into the care of the archives for permanent preservation and research access.

## Appraisal

The next step is called *[appraisal](https://dictionary.archivists.org/entry/appraisal.html)*: 

> The appraisal process goes something like this:
> When records are offered to the archives, the archivist gathers information about them. This information comes both from the contents of the records themselves, from the donor or creator of the records, or from additional research. The archivist wants to learn (if possible) who created the records, why, and when; this information will factor into the archivist’s appraisal report and later into the description of those records. Then the archivist considers things like these (among others):
> - Information and evidential value. 
> - Connection to the archives’ collection mandate
> - Rarity
> - Activity status
> - Reliability and authenticity.
> - Informational density.
> - Completeness
> - Physical condition
> - Conditions of access.
