> “If you were successful in the archives, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great archivist somewhere in your research process. Somebody recognized the value of the materials and made sure they ended up in an archives. Somebody invested in preserving them and organizing them and making them available to researchers. Somebody helped orient you to the archives and brought out materials for you to look at. If you found a document that no one knew was there—you didn’t discover that. Somebody else made that happen.”
