This answer is very institution-specific.

[Emma Sarconi](https://twitter.com/EmSarconi) of Princeton University Special Collections and [Anna J. Clutterbuck-Cook](https://twitter.com/feministlib) of the Massachusetts Historical Society discussed [this question](https://twitter.com/brimwats/status/1309539411080572934).

Emma noted that this isn't a frequently asked question as

> people typically inherently get it (not just at PU but other places I've been too). I would probably say "it's part of our security protocols designed ensure the safety of our materials"

Anna agreed, commenting that at her institution 

> that researchers must lock up their personal belongings (apart from laptop/phone) before entering the reading room as part of our security protocols. When giving tours and orientations we talk more broadly about how it's important to minimize the clutter on tables so that the fragile, unique materials can be handled safely, so that our staff are able to monitor how materials are being handled while they are in use, and finally that personal belongings are all checked upon exit to ensure no collections items leave the space.

There are differences between Special Collections and other libraries too:

> Because we are a freestanding special collections library with gallery space vs. a special collections room in a circulating library I think people are more primed to accept the "check your bag upon entry" process then e.g. at a college library.
