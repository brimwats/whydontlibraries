[Shannon Devlin](https://twitter.com/shannonohbannon), audiovisual archivist, notes that the one time when archivists *do* want to wear white gloves is when working with A/V materials:

> When working with film or photographic materials, gloves are needed in order to avoid finger print transfer, as well as avoiding denting and creasing the materials.

[Hereâ€™s a link](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/about/faqs/photographs.html#gloves) to an LOC FAQ about handling photographic materials:

**Should I wear gloves when handling photographs?**
Yes. Wear fitted, clean, lint-free cotton or nitrile gloves when handling photographs and films, which are easily marred by fingerprints. Because photographs and films are also easily dented and creased, wear well-fitting gloves to minimize clumsiness.

Thoroughly wash and dry hands before putting on gloves and ensure work area is clean.
