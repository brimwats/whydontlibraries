Information professionals are highly educated and trained professionalsâ€”the work that goes into organizing books, boxes, or paintings is highly complex. If a book is mishelved, a box mislabelled, or a painting mishandled there is a not-unlikely chance that that material may never be seen again. 

Supporting and training volunteers can be a highly time-intensive process. [As Steven Van Impe noted](https://twitter.com/RareBookLibAntw/status/1303742450721263616), sometimes it is just a matter of resources:
