[Beth DeBold,](https://twitter.com/eliza_audacis) a librarian at the Folger Library, offered a thoughtful tweet thread:

> This is a super complicated question! But in essence, a collection development policy provides guidance on what a collection is/was/shall be. A basic policy will outline collecting parameters about what an institution does(n’t) collect 
> Giving those with acquisitions/collecting responsibilities a measure and a base for discussion when considering whether to add a new item. A great policy will make this information transparent to anyone, including potential donors, as well as include info on deaccessioning 
> Overall, the collection development policy should be formed from the institutional mission, but should never be static; we should always be interrogating how/under what circumstances our collections were formed, and what they should strive to be in the future 
> As to who gets to make those decisions, it varies by institution and by collection—in my opinion, coll dev should be ethically separate from directors/CEOs, and should also be guided by people with relevant expertise. This is because collection development isn’t about collecting what is most obvious, or what flatters donors—it’s usually about building a wide-ranging, immersive picture of a topic, period, or particular person’s work. Acquisitions staff need breadth, depth, & sensitivity...
> ...to historical context, both of their specific collections and more broadly in order to do this work well. 


[Snowden Becker,](https://twitter.com/snowdenbecker) an audiovisual archivist and educator added that


> A good collections policy is a document that is both passive and active; both externally- and internally-facing! For those outside the institution, the collections policy communicates what we have, what we don't have (but do want), and what we don't have (and why). For those outside the institution, it is a tool of transparency and an expression of institutional values around collecting, preserving, and providing access to materials. 
> It can and should also address how appraisal/selection, deaccessioning, and rights administration work. Within the institution, a collection policy offers a framework for deciding whether to say yes or no to potential acquisitions. It keeps us mindful of what our intent in collecting is, and the reasonable limits we have set on our collecting scope. 
> Collection policies can serve as a useful check on our very human tendency to get distracted by big shiny new prospective acquisitions (and forget about our existing, less cute backlogs). We can use them to nicely say "thanks but no thanks" to collections we don't want. And, most importantly, they are living documents! They should be revisited regularly to make sure they reflect our current capacity, evolving values, and contemporary context. They are tools to help ensure that our collecting decisions are wise and thoughtful, not capricious.

[The Queer Zine Archive Project,](https://twitter.com/qzap) recommends the "[collection policy primer](http://zinelibraries.info/running-a-zine-library/collection-policy-primer/)" that they co-authored with Lisa Darms, who was at Fales/NYU at the time. It is an excellent read:

> A collection policy is just that… a policy or set of rules or guidelines that determine what your specific zine library focuses on. It can short and sweet, or long and library-speakish, or anything in-between. For example:

> QZAP collects zines by folks who self-identify as queer, and also material the is queer, regardless of the identity of the people who created it.(1)

> Alternately, here’s a description from the Carnegie Library:

> “The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh Main Zine Collection is made up of the donated Comic Release zine collection, which focuses heavily on comics and art zines, and the general adult zine collection, which also has literary, personal, and various types of informational zines, for example zines on activism, biking, gardening, and zine librarianship. We try to have a collection that is balanced across subject areas and that speaks to community needs and interests.”(2)
