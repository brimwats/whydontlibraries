Two librarians [offered a similar view](https://twitter.com/brimwats/status/1324033667153485828?s=20) on this:

> Thank you so much for thinking of us, but there is a long term cost for housing and preserving print material even without the initial purchase cost, and thus our collection development policy remains the same for both purchased and donated items.


> depends on who answers the email but it's often something like this: "Our institution doesn't collect those items because other institutions collect them. We focus on unique and unusual and rare materials. Thank you for thinking of us."
