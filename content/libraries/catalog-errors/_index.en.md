[Amy Leigh, a rare books cataloger,](https://twitter.com/rarebkcat), gave a well-detailed and [fantastic answer](https://twitter.com/rarebkcat/status/1328769328850870275) to this question:

We've been collecting and describing things for years/decades/centuries, and over the years the way we describe materials and the technology we use to navigate those descriptions has changed a great deal. 

However, when what we do changes, there's no magic wand to transform a description done in the old-style to a description done in the new-style, so descriptive data from decades (or centuries) ago will often live in a catalog alongside data created last week. 

This often leads to inconsistencies or things that look funny or, sometimes, errors because the description didn't change when our descriptive practices or technologies or knowledge changed. 

Alongside decades (centuries) of descriptive practices living next to each other, there are also material realities; technical services depts, who create the descriptions you access in a catalog, are often understaffed. 

Therefore, they can't spend as long as they might wish creating descriptions for materials, enhancing descriptions for materials, updating descriptions for materials, and ensuring consistency across the catalog.

That's... the short answer. A longer answer would talk about computer-mediated searching (online catalogs) vs. a person searching and being able to interpret what they're seeing (card catalogs, printed catalogs)...it might also talk about different imperatives for different parts of the collections on the inconsistency point.

tl;dr - People are creating the descriptions at a particular time in a particular place with particular reasons and material reality.

Finally, technical services staff are people and work within their own knowledges and biases. Descriptions and descriptive practices are not neutral and are shaped by the people that create them.
