One librarian [points out](https://twitter.com/killearnan/status/1329116126144585728) a simple issue: cost:

> $£€. Creating finding aids = human time, which = money. Most archives are underfunded for everyday operations so special projects are out.
Some attempts ArchiveGrid, National Archives UK Discovery, SCAN in Scotland but all have large organizations with funding behind them.


[Alexia, Assistant Archivist at Penn State](https://twitter.com/alexiadpuravida) replies:

> I think you might be underestimating the sheer volume of archival material in the world & the impossibility of describing it in any single way which would be at all intelligible...even with an endless budget & staff to try. [Furthermore] what is the possibility of getting enough people to cooperate & agree enough to make it happen, even if people wanted to?


[Jay Colbert](https://twitter.com/_WildeAtHeart), a metadata librarian points out that

> Not an archivist, but I feel like this sentiment still applies: every collection and community has different needs and serves a different purpose.
