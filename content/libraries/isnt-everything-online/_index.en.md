This question always brings up a [significant amount of discussion](https://twitter.com/brimwats/status/1326571892099211268)

[Jay Colbert](https://twitter.com/_WildeAtHeart), metadata librarian, said that

> Because these institutions cannot exist without the people/labor that curate and manage resources and the access to them. Even online resources require management and maintenance.

[Jessamyn](https://twitter.com/jessamyn), a public librarian, points to issues with information glut and bad metadata:

> Try to find an obituary from a random person (i.e. not a celeb) who died in the 90s. Go on, I'll wait.

[Allie Alvis](https://twitter.com/book_historia/) makes an argument about the uniqueness of physical items:

> Coming from a special collections angle, I would talk about the inherent uniqueness of hand-press era books, as well as the different kinds of physical evidence that do not translate well into a digital object.

[Eric Colleary, Curator of Theatre & Performing Arts at the Ransom Center](https://twitter.com/ecolleary) discussed copyright:

> My usual answer: Copyright & the physical volume of material make it difficult to put everything we have online. It's also labor-intensive. When an item is digitized, it may only take a minute to capture the image, but it can take a lot longer to create & record the metadata.


[Cassia](https://twitter.com/aravahshifra) points out that libries are not warehouses:

> I’d also point out this view is of libs/archives as mere warehouses. We provide many services (including labor that goes with digitization/access) and engage in meaningful labor and scholarship


> Maybe a pivot answer that may not be useful for your purposes, but after getting at direct concerns about material/labor I’d want to address what they think our purpose is and patrons who may be left out of such a discussion


[Necia Parker-Gibson](https://twitter.com/WiseAcreNecia) talks about demand:

> Many things aren't online, and won't be put online- or at least not for free. I'm thinking of a lot of proprietary information, gray literature, and the like.  Not all of that is in libraries, but if there wasn't demand from libraries, a lot of it would wither.


[Jaclyn](https://twitter.com/jacwilso) points to issues with access:

> Everything *isn't* online, and not all materials that are online are fully accessible (re: copyright as well as things like searchable PDFs). Not to mention not everyone has regular access to the internet, and there are so many in person services that have no online equivalent
