According to Beth DeBold's [report](https://twitter.com/eliza_audacis/status/1306665782525526025), Gabrielle Dudley at the Rose Library just mentioned 1 thing that is really crucialâ€”faculty & staff outside of the library often don't realize how long it takes to prepare a session. Adequately communicating how long and what kinds of work it takes "behind the scenes" to build a successful session is so important! Dudley also notes that "faculty need to understand we are partners in their teaching."
