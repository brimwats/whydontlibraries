As [Fletcher Durant](https://twitter.com/fletcherdurant/status/1307392683950866434), Head of Conservation and Preservation as the University of Florida notes:

> Books and paper age through a series of chemical reactions. Chem rxns, just like in chem labs accelerate with increased heat. Temp. and RH are two forms of heat. Lowering the temp by 10F cuts the aging rxns in half, thus extending the useable life of collections.

[Jessamyn](https://twitter.com/jessamyn), another librarian notes that

> Humidity breads mold, though we do try to keep the temperature reasonable. However this is a legacy building and sometimes its tough to adjust when the weather is being weird.
