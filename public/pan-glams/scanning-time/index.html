<p>This is a <a href="https://twitter.com/brimwats/status/1307723193180778497">common point of tension</a> between patrons and GLAMS staff. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just material, as <a href="https://twitter.com/nlschneider03">Norah Schneider</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Different paper types require different scanner types. We do other things than scan all day. Can’t just stick the pages into an auto feeder and let them go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another archivist <a href="https://twitter.com/helloginnybatty/status/1307725170472357888?s=20">notes that</a> scanning means dealing with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unwieldy objects, compounded by conservation problems 
Identifying copyright and/or ownership
I wish more items were standard A4 size with a complete accession record, but alas&hellip;and even in those cases it is incredibly expensive!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="difficulties">Difficulties</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ehh_ptr">Dr. Elizabeth Haven Hawley</a> of the University of Florida notes that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take long to scan things. But it does take a lot of work to make that scan part of a system so people can find it and to keep it online.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-world-underneath-the-scan">The World Underneath the Scan</h3>
<p>I (<a href="https://brimwats.com">Brian M. Watson</a>) also <a href="https://twitter.com/brimwats/status/1342303009284313088">discussed it at length</a> here, along with <a href="https://twitter.com/snowdenbecker">Snowden Becker</a>, audiovisual archivist and educator at UCLA Department of Information Studies.</p>
<p>I noted that there is an entire world underneath every picture you see on a library&rsquo;s website. Sure, you have have the actual image, but also you have everything connected to it: you have the metadata, you have the website, you have the servers, the principals the preservation, the code, the administration, and the too oft-forgotten staff.</p>
<p>Digitizing a book refers to the process of taking everthing about the book into account. Is the spine visible? What&rsquo;s useful about the paper quality? There is a lot more &ldquo;metadata&rdquo; in &ldquo;reality&rdquo; than there is online. but we need to capture as much of that as possible. So, the principals: here are ALCT&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.ala.org/alcts/resources/preserv/minimum-digitization-capture-recommendations">Minimum Digitization Capture Recommendations</a>, which is a good guide. but hardly comprehensive.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be <em>shameful</em> but most libraries have even more complicated setups.</p>
<h3 id="audiovisual-archives-and-more">Audiovisual Archives and More:</h3>
<p>AV archiving is herculean comparatively, as Snowden notes:</p>
<p>Scanning = capturing visual data, not conceptual data. Scanning a page of text creates an image with light parts and dark parts. A computer doesn’t naturally recognize those as words the way a brain does.</p>
<p>For analog recorded sound material, digitization doesn’t involve scanning at all, since most recorded sound media* wasn’t captured visually to begin with; it was either inscribed physically (grooved media like cylinder and disc recordings) or electronically (tape).</p>
<p>In that case, digitization usually means reproducing the sound via playback (usually with something resembling the original playback device) and re-recording that audio output signal with a digital capture device.</p>
<p>For motion picture film, scanning will create a visual record, but unless you then print that visual record out as individual frames on individual sheets of paper that you bind into a humongous flip book, the scan won’t be a digital version of the moving picture.</p>
<p>Projecting the film and capturing that projected moving image with a digital video camera will be a step closer, but seriously inferior as to image quality; you’ll also lose a lot of artifactual data that might be captured in a scan. So as with pages of text, scanning is not equal to digitization</p>
<p>*Motion picture films often had optical soundtracks, which ARE often scanned to digitize them, because in that case, the data is represented visually in a way that can be pretty straightforwardly “translated.” It’s already machine-readable information, and not human-readable.</p>
<p>So that might be the one instance I can think of where scan = digitization! But most soundtrack material exists in conjunction with picture material, so even that exception is subject to the larger rule. Scans capture ONE dimension—the visual—but full digitization requires more.</p>
<p>When we (archivists, librarians, other information professionals) talk about digitization, we mean capturing as much as possible of the essence of an object so that it can be “read” not just by human eyes (as with a scan) but using more powerful digital tools as well.</p>
<p>With a scanned book, you might have a picture of each page. But scanned image 17 of that book won’t be page 17 of the original—because scanned image 1 would be the front cover, 2 the inside front cover, 3 the flyleaf with handwritten inscription, etc.</p>
<p>A digitized version of that same book, however, would be one where those scanned images are wrapped in a layer of metadata and accompanied by QC’d copy of the OCR’d text, so you could interact with it digitally much the same as the original—skipping right to page 17.</p>
<p>As you might now be starting to see, that doesn’t happen automagically—although for simple objects like printed books, it’s less onerous to digitize than it once was. There is still a lot of complexity, variability, and (rarely visible) human labor involved.</p>
<p>Snowden went into this even deeper on Medium:</p>
