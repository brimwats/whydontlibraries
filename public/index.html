When giving tours and orientations we talk more broadly about how it\u0026rsquo;s important to minimize the clutter on tables so that the fragile, unique materials can be handled safely, so that our staff are able to monitor how materials are being handled while they are in use, and finally that personal belongings are all checked upon exit to ensure no collections items leave the space.\n There are differences between Special Collections and other libraries too:\n Because we are a freestanding special collections library with gallery space vs. a special collections room in a circulating library I think people are more primed to accept the \u0026ldquo;check your bag upon entry\u0026rdquo; process then e.g. at a college library.\n </p><p>personal belongings</p><p>visiting</p><p>rules</p>",

Sometimes that importance is immediately obvious, but sometimes its importance will not be apparant for many years later.

Yes. Wear fitted, clean, lint-free cotton or nitrile gloves when handling photographs and films, which are easily marred by fingerprints.

Handling a book with gloved hands could lead to accidentally torn pages when the gloves catch on fragile edges, or a dropped book if the gloves prove to be loose or slippery. Cotton gloves in particular have a tendency to lift fragments from pages, including pigments. Their fibers can catch in cracks that are invisible to the naked eye, further damaging friable pigments and inks. This also means that cotton gloves retain a lot of dirt, making them not so clean after all! In this same vein, gloves cause the hands to sweat, and this moisture can penetrate the gloves to wind up on the books. Ew!  Finally, a helpful flowchart from Derangement and Description\n Will you be handling photographs? You might need to wear gloves. Are you a bandleader, performing a medical procedures, or Mickey Mouse? You are already wearing gloves. Otherwise?

Go on, I\u0026rsquo;ll wait.\n Allie Alvis makes an argument about the uniqueness of physical items:\n Coming from a special collections angle, I would talk about the inherent uniqueness of hand-press era books, as well as the different kinds of physical evidence that do not translate well into a digital object.\n Eric Colleary, Curator of Theatre \u0026amp; Performing Arts at the Ransom Center discussed copyright:\n My usual answer: Copyright \u0026amp; the physical volume of material make it difficult to put everything we have online. It\u0026rsquo;s also labor-intensive. When an item is digitized, it may only take a minute to capture the image, but it can take a lot longer to create \u0026amp; record the metadata.\n Cassia points out that libries are not warehouses:\n I’d also point out this view is of libs\/archives as mere warehouses. We provide many services (including labor that goes with digitization\/access) and engage in meaningful labor and scholarship\n  Maybe a pivot answer that may not be useful for your purposes, but after getting at direct concerns about material\/labor I’d want to address what they think our purpose is and patrons who may be left out of such a discussion\n Necia Parker-Gibson talks about demand:\n Many things aren\u0026rsquo;t online, and won\u0026rsquo;t be put online- or at least not for free. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of a lot of proprietary information, gray literature, and the like. Not all of that is in libraries, but if there wasn\u0026rsquo;t demand from libraries, a lot of it would wither.\n Jaclyn points to issues with access:\n Everything isn\u0026rsquo;t online, and not all materials that are online are fully accessible (re: copyright as well as things like searchable PDFs).

A longer answer would talk about computer-mediated searching (online catalogs) vs. a person searching and being able to interpret what they\u0026rsquo;re seeing (card catalogs, printed catalogs)\u0026hellip;it might also talk about different imperatives for different parts of the collections on the inconsistency point.\ntl;dr - People are creating the descriptions at a particular time in a particular place with particular reasons and material reality.\nFinally, technical services staff are people and work within their own knowledges and biases.

							value: "How do GLAMS determine what to collect? Or, who gets to decide what gets collected and why?",
							label: "<p>Beth DeBold, a librarian at the Folger Library, offered a thoughtful tweet thread:\n This is a super complicated question! But in essence, a collection development policy provides guidance on what a collection is\/was\/shall be. A basic policy will outline collecting parameters about what an institution does(n’t) collect Giving those with acquisitions\/collecting responsibilities a measure and a base for discussion when considering whether to add a new item. A great policy will make this information transparent to anyone, including potential donors, as well as include info on deaccessioning Overall, the collection development policy should be formed from the institutional mission, but should never be static; we should always be interrogating how\/under what circumstances our collections were formed, and what they should strive to be in the future As to who gets to make those decisions, it varies by institution and by collection—in my opinion, coll dev should be ethically separate from directors\/CEOs, and should also be guided by people with relevant expertise. This is because collection development isn’t about collecting what is most obvious, or what flatters donors—it’s usually about building a wide-ranging, immersive picture of a topic, period, or particular person’s work. Acquisitions staff need breadth, depth, \u0026amp; sensitivity\u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;to historical context, both of their specific collections and more broadly in order to do this work well.\n Snowden Becker, an audiovisual archivist and educator added that\n A good collections policy is a document that is both passive and active; both externally- and internally-facing! For those outside the institution, the collections policy communicates what we have, what we don\u0026rsquo;t have (but do want), and what we don\u0026rsquo;t have (and why). For those outside the institution, it is a tool of transparency and an expression of institutional values around collecting, preserving, and providing access to materials. It can and should also address how appraisal\/selection, deaccessioning, and rights administration work. Within the institution, a collection policy offers a framework for deciding whether to say yes or no to potential acquisitions. It keeps us mindful of what our intent in collecting is, and the reasonable limits we have set on our collecting scope. Collection policies can serve as a useful check on our very human tendency to get distracted by big shiny new prospective acquisitions (and forget about our existing, less cute backlogs). We can use them to nicely say \u0026ldquo;thanks but no thanks\u0026rdquo; to collections we don\u0026rsquo;t want. And, most importantly, they are living documents! They should be revisited regularly to make sure they reflect our current capacity, evolving values, and contemporary context. They are tools to help ensure that our collecting decisions are wise and thoughtful, not capricious.\n The Queer Zine Archive Project, recommends the \u0026ldquo;collection policy primer\u0026rdquo; that they co-authored with Lisa Darms, who was at Fales\/NYU at the time. It is an excellent read:\n A collection policy is just that… a policy or set of rules or guidelines that determine what your specific zine library focuses on. It can short and sweet, or long and library-speakish, or anything in-between. For example:\n  QZAP collects zines by folks who self-identify as queer, and also material the is queer, regardless of the identity of the people who created it.(1)\n  Alternately, here’s a description from the Carnegie Library:\n  “The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh Main Zine Collection is made up of the donated Comic Release zine collection, which focuses heavily on comics and art zines, and the general adult zine collection, which also has literary, personal, and various types of informational zines, for example zines on activism, biking, gardening, and zine librarianship. We try to have a collection that is balanced across subject areas and that speaks to community needs and interests.”(2)\n </p><p>collections</p><p>policies</p><p>development</p>",

							label: "<p>Intro This is a common point of tension between patrons and GLAMS staff. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s just material, as Norah Schneider notes:\n Different paper types require different scanner types. We do other things than scan all day. Can’t just stick the pages into an auto feeder and let them go.\n Another archivist notes that scanning means dealing with\n Unwieldy objects, compounded by conservation problems Identifying copyright and\/or ownership I wish more items were standard A4 size with a complete accession record, but alas\u0026hellip;and even in those cases it is incredibly expensive!\n Difficulties Dr. Elizabeth Haven Hawley of the University of Florida notes that:\n It doesn\u0026rsquo;t take long to scan things. But it does take a lot of work to make that scan part of a system so people can find it and to keep it online.\n The World Underneath the Scan I (Brian M. Watson) also discussed it at length here, along with Snowden Becker, audiovisual archivist and educator at UCLA Department of Information Studies.\nI noted that there is an entire world underneath every picture you see on a library\u0026rsquo;s website. Sure, you have have the actual image, but also you have everything connected to it: you have the metadata, you have the website, you have the servers, the principals the preservation, the code, the administration, and the too oft-forgotten staff.\nDigitizing a book refers to the process of taking everthing about the book into account. Is the spine visible? What\u0026rsquo;s useful about the paper quality? There is a lot more \u0026ldquo;metadata\u0026rdquo; in \u0026ldquo;reality\u0026rdquo; than there is online. but we need to capture as much of that as possible. So, the principals: here are ALCT\u0026rsquo;s Minimum Digitization Capture Recommendations, which is a good guide. but hardly comprehensive.\nIt wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be shameful but most libraries have even more complicated setups.\nAudiovisual Archives and More: AV archiving is herculean comparatively, as Snowden notes:\nScanning = capturing visual data, not conceptual data. Scanning a page of text creates an image with light parts and dark parts. A computer doesn’t naturally recognize those as words the way a brain does.\nFor analog recorded sound material, digitization doesn’t involve scanning at all, since most recorded sound media* wasn’t captured visually to begin with; it was either inscribed physically (grooved media like cylinder and disc recordings) or electronically (tape).\nIn that case, digitization usually means reproducing the sound via playback (usually with something resembling the original playback device) and re-recording that audio output signal with a digital capture device.\nFor motion picture film, scanning will create a visual record, but unless you then print that visual record out as individual frames on individual sheets of paper that you bind into a humongous flip book, the scan won’t be a digital version of the moving picture.\nProjecting the film and capturing that projected moving image with a digital video camera will be a step closer, but seriously inferior as to image quality; you’ll also lose a lot of artifactual data that might be captured in a scan. So as with pages of text, scanning is not equal to digitization\n*Motion picture films often had optical soundtracks, which ARE often scanned to digitize them, because in that case, the data is represented visually in a way that can be pretty straightforwardly “translated.” It’s already machine-readable information, and not human-readable.\nSo that might be the one instance I can think of where scan = digitization! But most soundtrack material exists in conjunction with picture material, so even that exception is subject to the larger rule. Scans capture ONE dimension—the visual—but full digitization requires more.\nWhen we (archivists, librarians, other information professionals) talk about digitization, we mean capturing as much as possible of the essence of an object so that it can be “read” not just by human eyes (as with a scan) but using more powerful digital tools as well.\nWith a scanned book, you might have a picture of each page. But scanned image 17 of that book won’t be page 17 of the original—because scanned image 1 would be the front cover, 2 the inside front cover, 3 the flyleaf with handwritten inscription, etc.\nA digitized version of that same book, however, would be one where those scanned images are wrapped in a layer of metadata and accompanied by QC’d copy of the OCR’d text, so you could interact with it digitally much the same as the original—skipping right to page 17.\nAs you might now be starting to see, that doesn’t happen automagically—although for simple objects like printed books, it’s less onerous to digitize than it once was. There is still a lot of complexity, variability, and (rarely visible) human labor involved.\nSnowden went into this even deeper on Medium:\nhttps:\/\/medium.com\/@snowdenbecker\/to-see-ourselves-as-others-see-us-on-archives-visibility-and-value-bbdc4c5d7e5d\n</p><p>scanning</p><p>photocopies</p><p>labor</p>",

							value: "If you specialize in collecting X, why don\u0027t you collect every single item related to X?",
							label: "<p>Acquisition The process by which an GLAMS acquires material is called acquisition.\nThe simplest answer to this question was articulated by archivist Jordan Marie :\n Not every item related to a topic has the same level of historical value; we have to pick and choose those which are the most relevant\/important. We also don’t have the funds\/staff to collect every item, store them, and preserve them long-term.\n The Peel Art Gallery Archives also addressed the entire process of acquisition in their blog post:\n People are often surprised to learn that typically only about five percent of most organizational records will be preserved permanently in the organization’s archives (we’ll see why in a moment). We call the acquisition of such records a transfer because the ownership of the records isn’t changing; they are simply coming into the care of the archives for permanent preservation and research access.\n Appraisal The next step is called appraisal:\n The appraisal process goes something like this: When records are offered to the archives, the archivist gathers information about them. This information comes both from the contents of the records themselves, from the donor or creator of the records, or from additional research. The archivist wants to learn (if possible) who created the records, why, and when; this information will factor into the archivist’s appraisal report and later into the description of those records. Then the archivist considers things like these (among others):\n Information and evidential value. Connection to the archives’ collection mandate Rarity Activity status Reliability and authenticity. Informational density. Completeness Physical condition Conditions of access.   Read the whole post for all the detail you can handle!\n</p><p>specialization</p><p>collection</p>",

ATM, staff supports the maximum amount of volunteers. When we have projects for volunteers, we post them on social media. Follow us if you want to help us later.\n Additionally, as Heather Tornblom notes,\n defending GLAM work as paid work is important because reliance on volunteers normalises the practice.
